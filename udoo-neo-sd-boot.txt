#
# This is a boot script to load a file named imx6board_efi.fd
# from the first SD mass storage device and then jump
# to it. It must be compiled to an SCR file and placed at
# the root of the SD card for u-boot to pick it up.
#
#  Compile this script to a format u-boot understands:
#
#   mkimage -C none -A arm -T script -d udoo-neo-sd-boot.txt boot.scr
#
#  Copy boot.scr to the root of the SD card.
#
#
# mkimage can be found at the root of the u-boot tree after
# doing a build of u-boot.
